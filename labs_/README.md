## Labs

Preparing for main work we were suplied with some knowledge in Mashine Learning - our mentor was asking us to do some labs (from 1 to 4).

### Lab1 - the beginning and some origins

Linear regression, data validation, binary linear classification, gradient descent.

### Lab2 - some introduction to pytorch

Multilayer perceptron, linear multi-classification problem, universal approximation theorem, backpropagation, autoencoders.

### Lab3 - some introduction to convolutional neural networks

Classic architecture, regularization, data augmentation, modern architectures.

I added code from ML contest (check [this](https://github.com/birshert/Darin/tree/master/KaggleFight))

### Lab-4 - introduction to reinforcement learning

Multi-armed bandit problem, markov decison process, SARSA and Q-learning.
